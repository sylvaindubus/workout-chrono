- ~~Make clear that you can add a step without a duration~~
- ~~Add some sounds during the last 5 seconds of a step~~
- ~~Add a presentation screen~~
- Find a better name
- Improve icon management
- Make things a bit prettier, add smooth animations and a cool mascot
- Improve progress bar features
- Support drag-and-drop on mobile
